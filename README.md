# Random Astronomy Photo

Random Astronomy Photo is a web app that uses NASA's Astronomy Photo of the Day (APOD) API to display random astronomy photos and cool facts about them.

The app was built using JavaScript, React, React Router, HTML, and CSS.

## Updates

Improvements and features I have completed:

* Implemented support for videos.
* Added "get by date" page that allows the user to fetch APOD media by date.

## Next Steps

Improvements and features I am working on:

* Add a feature that stores previously fetched photos in a gallery at the bottom of the page, with prev and next buttons to scroll through them.
* Redesign buttons to look more modern and visually appealing.
* Handle "apod.nasa.gov refused to connect errors" with more helpful error message redirecting user to APOD page for that date.

## Create React App
