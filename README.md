# Random Astronomy Photo

Random Astronomy Photo is a web app that uses NASA's Astronomy Photo of the Day (APOD) API to display random astronomy photos and cool facts about them.

The app was built using JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS.

## Updates

The APOD API occasionally returns a video instead of an image. I have now implemented support for videos.

## Next Steps

Improvements and features I am working on:

* Add a "get APOD by date" feature that retrieves the photo for a given date.
* Add a feature that stores previously fetched photos in a gallery at the bottom of the page, with prev and next buttons to scroll through them.
* Redesign header and buttons to look more modern and visually appealing.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
